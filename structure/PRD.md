# Slack Clone MVP - Product Requirements Document

## Project Overview
A real-time team communication platform enabling instant messaging, file sharing, and channel-based discussions using SvelteKit and Appwrite deployed on AWS. The MVP focuses on core messaging functionality while maintaining extensibility for future features and scalability requirements.

## User Roles & Core Workflows

1. Workspace Admins create and manage workspaces, configure workspace settings, and control member access through direct invites and invite links.

2. Workspace Members participate in channels, send messages with basic formatting and file attachments, and engage in direct messaging with other workspace members.

3. Channel Owners create public or private channels, manage channel settings, and control channel membership for private channels.

4. Regular Users send messages, react to messages with emojis, mention other users with @mentions, and search through message history.

## Technical Foundation

### Data Models
```typescript
User {
  id: string
  email: string
  fullName: string
  displayName: string
  avatar: string
  status: enum
  workspaceIds: string[]
}

Workspace {
  id: string
  name: string
  members: { userId: string, role: enum }[]
  settings: object
}

Channel {
  id: string
  workspaceId: string
  name: string
  type: enum
  members: string[]
}

Message {
  id: string
  channelId: string
  userId: string
  content: string
  attachments: object[]
  mentions: string[]
  reactions: { emoji: string, userIds: string[] }[]
}
```

### Core API Endpoints
```typescript
